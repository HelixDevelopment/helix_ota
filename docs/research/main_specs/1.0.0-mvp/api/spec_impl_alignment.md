| Revision | 4 |

| Created | 2026-06-08 |
| Status | active (decision memo — additive + group breaking WIDENs landed; row-4 per-device telemetry **filters** + row-7 group/members **pagination** RESOLVED 2026-06-10; row-4 richer numeric fields still ingest-gated) |
| Landed (2026-06-10) | **Row 4 filters** — per-device telemetry now accepts the spec filter params (`50ef5c6`, `feat(api): per-device telemetry filters + group/members pagination`; OpenAPI synced + redocly-clean). **Row 7 pagination** — group + members list now paginated. Both previously-DEFERRED WIDEN bits are RESOLVED. Dashboard API client updated in lockstep (`b0b8ee2`). Still open on row 4: the richer per-item numeric fields `duration_ms`/`bytes_transferred`, blocked on UNVERIFIED ingest (§9). |
| Operator ruling (2026-06-08) | **WIDEN impl to the fuller spec** for the remaining breaking divergences. Executing in sub-batches. **Landed:** group row 6 id-key `id`→`group_id` + row 8 member-add → batch `{device_ids}` → 200 `{added, already_member, not_found}` (device-registration-aware); **row 1 audit `actor` → object `{user_id, subject}`**; **row 4 structural** — per-device telemetry `events`→`items` + `next_cursor`, **newest-first**, `?limit`/`?cursor` pagination (handler-side over bounded history). **`GET /groups/{id}/members` → `items[]` of `{device_id, added_at}`** (store gained an `added_at` membership column + `ListGroupMembersDetailed` on memory + pgx, real-DB parity). Remaining: row 4 DEFERRED bits (richer per-item fields `duration_ms`/`bytes_transferred` — UNVERIFIED ingest; `?event_type`/`?since`/`?until`/`?deployment_id` filters), row 7 (group + members list pagination — deferred, groups bounded). |
| Landed (2026-06-08, operator-approved additive WIDENs) | **Row 2 (audit query filters)** — `?since`/`?until` RFC3339 bounds on `GET /audit` (028e656). **Row 5 core (telemetry overview)** — `failure_rate = failure/(success+failure)` + `by_state` (028e656). **Row 6 partial (`member_count`)** — added to `GroupView` on get/list/update (live count via `ListGroupMembers`). All three additive (new optional params / new JSON fields), wire-compatible, real-DB parity where a store change applied. Remaining rows (1 audit actor object, 4 per-device telemetry pagination/`events`→`items`, 8 batch member-add, plus the `id`→`group_id` rename) are BREAKING wire changes still gated behind an operator WIDEN/TRIM ruling. |
| Status summary | A per-divergence decision memo over the eight spec-vs-implementation gaps recorded in [`implemented_endpoints.md`](implemented_endpoints.md) §10 for the audit-read, telemetry-read, and device-group operational surfaces. For each gap it recommends **WIDEN-impl** (bring the handler up to the fuller [`operational_endpoints.md`](operational_endpoints.md) spec) or **TRIM-spec** (accept the leaner as-built shape as canonical and amend the prose spec), with rationale, effort, risk, and the blast radius (tests / e2e / HelixQA bank). It is a MEMO only — it recommends; it changes no `server/` code, no `go.mod`, no tests, no existing file. |
| Authority | Recommendations are advisory. The operator decides WIDEN-vs-TRIM per row (Constitution §11.4.66 — closed-set decisions belong to the operator; §11.4.122 — no silent removal of a shipped capability). |
| Anti-bluff | Per Constitution §11.4.6 (no-guessing): every "impl does" cell was confirmed by direct read of the cited handler function in `server/internal/api/`; every "spec wants" cell was confirmed by direct read of `operational_endpoints.md`. The §10 register at the foot of this memo lists what is **UNVERIFIED** (effort/risk estimates, NFR numbers, store-method availability) and is not asserted as fact. |

## 1. purpose_and_scope

`implemented_endpoints.md` §10 records eight concrete shape divergences between the prose
operational spec (`operational_endpoints.md`) and the code that actually shipped
(`handlers_audit.go`, `handlers_telemetry.go`, `handlers_group.go`). The as-built doc states the
**code is authoritative** but does not decide which side *should* win going forward. This memo
makes that decision per gap:

- **WIDEN-impl** — the spec's fuller shape carries real operational value; raise the handler to it
  (the as-built doc becomes a transient under-build state, the prose spec stays the target).
- **TRIM-spec** — the leaner as-built shape is sufficient for the 1.0.0-MVP; adopt it as canonical
  and amend `operational_endpoints.md` + `openapi.yaml` to match (no code churn; doc-sync only).

Scope is exactly the eight §10 gaps across audit / telemetry / groups. Out of scope: rollout
(`implemented_endpoints.md` §10 marks it *consistent* with the brick), roles (also *consistent*),
and the PLANNED recall endpoint (§8 — a missing feature, not a shape divergence).

## 2. how_to_read_this_memo

- **`impl does` cites `file:func`** — the exact handler confirmed by reading the source this pass.
- **WIDEN/TRIM** is the recommendation; the operator owns the final call (§11.4.66).
- **Effort** is a relative T-shirt size (S / M / L) for the handler+store+test work; the absolute
  hours are UNVERIFIED (§9) because the pgx store-method availability for the wider shapes is not
  confirmed in this memo.
- **Risk** is the chance the change breaks an existing green test or an as-built consumer.
- **Blast radius** names the test layers and HelixQA bank entries that would change. The HelixQA
  bank path (`tools/helixqa/banks/atmosphere.yaml`) is the constitutional convention (§11.4.58);
  whether that exact file exists in this repo is UNVERIFIED (§9) — treat it as "the project's
  Challenge bank, wherever it lives".

## 3. evidence_basis_confirmed_against_code

Each divergence below was re-confirmed against source this pass (not taken on trust from §10):

- **Audit actor flat-string** — `handlers_telemetry.go` aside, the audit entry is built in
  `handlers_audit.go:auditMiddleware` (`store.AuditEntry{ActorSubject: claims.Subject, ...}`,
  L36–45) and rendered by `toAuditLogEntry` into `AuditLogEntry`; the wire `actor` is a single
  string, never a `{user_id, subject}` object. Spec `operational_endpoints.md` §4.3 shows
  `"actor": { "user_id": ..., "subject": ... }` (L234).
- **Audit query params** — `handlers_audit.go:handleListAudit` reads only `action`,
  `resource_type`, `cursor`, `limit` (L133–147). Spec §4.3 (L224–226) lists additionally
  `?actor`, `?resource_id`, `?since`, `?until`.
- **Audit response type name** — code emits `AuditLogList` (`handleListAudit`, L157); spec §4.3
  calls it `AuditList` (L227).
- **Telemetry per-device** — `handlers_telemetry.go:handleDeviceTelemetry` consumes no query
  params, returns full history in store order under `events` (L51–67); per-event `TelemetryEventView`
  (L14–22) has no `id`/`success`/`duration_ms`/`bytes_transferred`. Spec §5.1 (L270–292) wants
  `?limit/?cursor/?event_type/?since/?until/?deployment_id`, newest-first, an `items` array, and
  those richer fields.
- **Telemetry overview** — `handlers_telemetry.go:handleTelemetryOverview` (L71–82) returns the
  minimal `TelemetryOverview{EventCounts, Total}` (L32–35), no scoping. Spec §5.2 (L308–342) wants
  `scope`, `devices_total`, `devices_reporting`, `by_state` (latest-per-device), `failure_rate`,
  `generated_at`, plus `?deployment_id/?os/?since/?until`.
- **Group view fields + id key** — `handlers_group.go:GroupView` (L28–33) is
  `{id, name, description, created_at}`; no `filter_criteria`, no `member_count`, id key is `id`.
  Spec §6.1 (L39–44) shows `group_id`, `filter_criteria`, `member_count`.
- **Group list pagination** — `handlers_group.go:handleListGroups` (L79–90) returns all groups,
  `GroupList{Items}` (L36–38), no `?name/?limit/?cursor`, no `next_cursor`. Spec §6.2 (L53–54)
  wants paginated `{items, next_cursor}` + `?name=` prefix.
- **Group member add semantics** — `handlers_group.go:handleAddGroupMember` (L152–171) takes a
  single `MemberAdd{DeviceID}` (L41–43) and returns `204`. Spec §6.4 (L89–98) wants a batch
  `{device_ids:[...]}` returning `200` with `GroupMemberAddResult{added, already_member, not_found}`.
- **Group member list shape** — `handlers_group.go:handleListGroupMembers` (L139–150) returns
  `GroupMembers{group_id, device_ids:[string]}`. Spec §6.4 (L76–85) wants paginated `items` of
  `{device_id, added_at}`.

| # | divergence | spec wants | impl does (file:func) | recommendation | rationale (1-line) | blast radius (tests / e2e / bank) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | audit `actor` shape | nested `{user_id, subject}` | flat string = subject→user-id fallback (`handlers_audit.go:auditMiddleware` + `toAuditLogEntry`) | **WIDEN-impl** | `user_id` is the durable join key for an actor whose token subject rotates; a flat string loses the audit→users FK the schema already models (`user_id ON DELETE SET NULL`). | audit wire unit test (actor JSON shape); audit-read integration test; e2e audit-trail bank entry |
| 2 | audit query filters | `?actor`,`?resource_id`,`?since`,`?until` (+ existing) | only `?action`,`?resource_type`,`?cursor`,`?limit` (`handlers_audit.go:handleListAudit`) | **WIDEN-impl** | Audit's primary forensic use is time-window + per-actor + per-resource queries; without `?since/?until` an admin cannot scope an incident review — this is the audit feature's reason to exist. | `handleListAudit` filter unit tests; `store.AuditFilter` store tests; integration query-param matrix; bank: audit-filter Challenge |
| 3 | audit response type name | `AuditList` | `AuditLogList` (`handlers_audit.go:handleListAudit`) | **TRIM-spec** | Pure naming; the wire JSON keys (`items`/`next_cursor`) already match. Renaming the Go type churns code + tests for zero behavioural value. | none in code; doc/openapi rename only |
| 4 | per-device telemetry: pagination + newest-first + filters + richer fields | `?limit/?cursor/?event_type/?since/?until/?deployment_id`, newest-first, `items[]` with `id/success/duration_ms/bytes_transferred` | newest-first `items[]` + `?limit/?cursor` (R7, 2a48ab5) + filter params **RESOLVED 2026-06-10 (`50ef5c6`)**; richer numeric fields still UNVERIFIED-ingest-gated (`handlers_telemetry.go:handleDeviceTelemetry`) | **WIDEN-impl (phased) — filters LANDED 2026-06-10; `duration_ms`/`bytes_transferred` still deferred (ingest)** | Pagination + newest-first shipped R7; the `?event_type`/`?since`/`?until`/`?deployment_id` filters landed 2026-06-10. `duration_ms/bytes_transferred` depend on the telemetry ingest carrying them (UNVERIFIED §9) — still deferred until the event source supplies them. | `TelemetryEventView` wire unit test; `handleDeviceTelemetry` param/order tests; `store.TelemetryForDevice` → paginated/filtered store test; integration newest-first + filter test; bank: device-telemetry-history Challenge |
| 5 | telemetry overview: richer fields + scoping | `scope`,`devices_total`,`devices_reporting`,`by_state` (latest-per-device),`failure_rate`,`generated_at` + `?deployment_id/?os/?since/?until` | minimal `{event_counts, total}` (`handlers_telemetry.go:handleTelemetryOverview`/`TelemetryOverview`) | **WIDEN-impl (core fields) + TRIM-spec (drop `?os` for MVP)** | `failure_rate` + `by_state` (one-device-once) is the fleet-health number operators actually watch; raw `event_counts` over-counts chatty devices. Keep it. `?os` scoping + `devices_total/reporting` need a per-device latest-state query (`DISTINCT ON`) — valuable but heavier; `?os` specifically is low-MVP-value, TRIM it. | `TelemetryOverview` wire unit test; `handleTelemetryOverview` aggregate test; new `store.TelemetryOverview`/latest-per-device store test; integration scoping test; bank: fleet-health Challenge |
| 6 | `GroupView` fields + id key | `group_id`, `filter_criteria`, `member_count` | `id`, no `filter_criteria`, no `member_count` (`handlers_group.go:GroupView`/`toGroupView`) | **split: TRIM-spec on id key (`id`); WIDEN-impl on `member_count`; TRIM-spec on `filter_criteria` for MVP** | `id` vs `group_id` is cosmetic and `id` matches the rest of the API's resource-id convention — TRIM the spec to `id`. `member_count` is a cheap, high-value list affordance — WIDEN. `filter_criteria` (dynamic membership) is explicitly UNVERIFIED/unevaluated in the spec itself (§6 intro) and MVP supports static membership only — TRIM to "static-only" for 1.0.0, defer dynamic. | `GroupView` wire unit test; `handleCreateGroup`/`handleGetGroup`/`handleUpdateGroup` tests; `store.Group` + count query; integration group-CRUD test; bank: group-CRUD Challenge |
| 7 | `GET /groups` + `GET /groups/{id}/members` pagination | paginated `{items, next_cursor}` (+ `?name=` prefix on groups) | **RESOLVED 2026-06-10 (`50ef5c6`)** — group + members list now paginated (`handlers_group.go:handleListGroups`/`handleListGroupMembers`) | **WIDEN-impl — LANDED 2026-06-10** (was TRIM-spec/defer) | Previously deferred (groups bounded); widened to paginated `{items, next_cursor}` this session alongside the telemetry-filter work, with the dashboard client updated in lockstep (`b0b8ee2`). No longer a standing divergence. | `handleListGroups`/`handleListGroupMembers` param tests + `store.ListGroups`/members filter/cursor store test + integration; bank: group-CRUD / group-membership Challenges re-assert the paginated shape |
| 8 | group member add: single+`204` vs batch+`200`+result | batch `{device_ids:[...]}` → `200` `{added, already_member, not_found}` | single `{device_id}` → `204`, no partial-success report (`handlers_group.go:handleAddGroupMember`/`MemberAdd`) | **WIDEN-impl** | Cohort building is inherently bulk; one-device-per-round-trip is N calls + N audit rows for a fleet add, and the `not_found`/`already_member` report is exactly the partial-success feedback an operator needs. The store method the spec names (`AddGroupMembers`) is plural by design. | `MemberAdd`→batch wire unit test; `handleAddGroupMember` batch + idempotency + not-found tests; `store.AddGroupMember`→`AddGroupMembers` store test; integration batch-add test; **audit impact:** `deriveAuditAction` `group_member` verb already covers it (`handlers_audit.go`); bank: group-membership Challenge |

## 5. per_divergence_rationale

### 5.1 audit (rows 1–3)

The audit subsystem's only purpose is forensic reconstruction. Two of its three gaps directly
defeat that purpose:

- **Row 1 (WIDEN).** The schema keeps a nullable `user_id` precisely so a record outlives the actor
  (`operational_endpoints.md` §4 intro, `ON DELETE SET NULL`). The handler currently flattens to a
  single subject string. Surfacing `{user_id, subject}` restores the durable join key for
  cross-actor queries; effort is small because both values already exist at write time
  (`claims.Subject` is captured; the `users.id` resolution the spec describes in §4.1 L140 is the
  only new lookup). **Effort S–M. Risk LOW** — additive JSON field; existing string consumers
  break only if they assumed `actor` is a string (the as-built doc says it is, so an as-built
  consumer would break — gate this behind the operator's WIDEN decision).
- **Row 2 (WIDEN).** `?since/?until` time-window scoping is the single most-used audit query in
  incident response; `?actor`/`?resource_id` complete the "who touched what" triad. The store seam
  (`store.AuditFilter`) is already the extension point — adding fields there + parsing+validating
  the RFC-3339 params in `handleListAudit` is the bulk of the work. **Effort M. Risk LOW-MED** —
  new validation paths (malformed `since/until` → `400`) must be tested to avoid §11.4.1 FAIL-bluffs.
- **Row 3 (TRIM).** Type *name* only; the wire contract (`items`, `next_cursor`) is identical.
  Renaming `AuditLogList`→`AuditList` is pure churn. Adopt `AuditLogList` as canonical; fix the
  prose + openapi. **Effort S (doc only). Risk NONE.**

### 5.2 telemetry (rows 4–5)

- **Row 4 (WIDEN, phased).** Per-device history is unbounded and the handler returns *all of it in
  insertion order*. At any real device age this is a latency/payload problem and gives no
  "most-recent-first" affordance. Pagination + newest-first + `?event_type`/`?since`/`?until`
  filtering are load-bearing and should be widened. The richer fields split: `id` and `success`
  are cheap derivations; `duration_ms`/`bytes_transferred` require the telemetry ingest to *carry*
  those values — whether `store.TelemetryRecord` / the `ota-protocol` event already has them is
  **UNVERIFIED (§9)**. Phase: ship pagination+order+filters first; add the rich numeric fields only
  once the ingest is confirmed to supply them (else they would be a §11.4-bluff of always-zero
  fields). **Effort M–L. Risk MED** — touches the store query contract (`TelemetryForDevice` gains
  filter/cursor params) and changes the response *key* (`events`→`items`), which is a breaking wire
  change an as-built consumer would feel; gate behind the operator decision.
- **Row 5 (WIDEN core / TRIM `?os`).** `failure_rate` + `by_state` computed as *latest-event-per-device*
  is the honest fleet-health number; the current raw `event_counts` over-weights chatty devices and
  has no health ratio at all. Widen to `by_state`/`failure_rate`/`devices_total`/`devices_reporting`/
  `generated_at`. The latest-per-device aggregate is a `DISTINCT ON (device_id)` query (spec §5.3
  alludes to it) — real work in the store. `?os` scoping is the weakest item (needs a device-OS
  join, low MVP demand) — TRIM it for 1.0.0, keep `?deployment_id` + time window. **Effort L.
  Risk MED** — additive response fields are safe; the new store aggregate must be tested for the
  zero-devices edge (`failure_rate` = 0 when `devices_reporting` = 0, per spec §5.2 L345).

### 5.3 groups (rows 6–8)

- **Row 6 (split).** Three sub-decisions: **id key** `id` (TRIM — matches the rest of the API,
  renaming to `group_id` churns every group test for cosmetics); **`member_count`** (WIDEN — a
  cheap COUNT, high-value in list/detail UIs); **`filter_criteria`** (TRIM for MVP — the spec
  *itself* flags dynamic-membership evaluation as UNVERIFIED and MVP as static-only, §6 intro
  L13–14; storing+returning an un-evaluated selector is a latent §11.4-bluff "feature that doesn't
  work", so defer until the evaluator lands). **Effort S–M. Risk LOW.**
- **Row 7 (TRIM, defer).** Groups are operator-curated and bounded (not per-device rows), so an
  un-paginated list is acceptable at MVP scale. Adopt the lean shape as canonical now; document the
  paginated `{items, next_cursor}` + `?name=` as a future widen triggered if groups ever get
  created programmatically. **Effort S (doc). Risk LOW.**
- **Row 8 (WIDEN).** Membership is inherently bulk (build a cohort = add many devices). Single-add
  forces N round-trips + N audit rows and gives no partial-success feedback; the spec's
  `{added, already_member, not_found}` is precisely the report an operator needs, and the store
  method is plural by design (`AddGroupMembers`). The `204`→`200`+body and `device_id`→`device_ids`
  changes are breaking for an as-built single-add consumer — gate behind the operator decision.
  **Effort M. Risk MED** — must test idempotent re-add (counted, not error) and unknown-device
  (`not_found`, partial success) to avoid a §11.4.1 FAIL-bluff on the partial path.

## 6. overall_recommendation_first_things_first

Order by (operational-harm-if-left-lean) × (low effort/risk first), and honor §11.4.72 only where
applicable (no audio surface here, so pure operational priority):

1. **Audit query filters (row 2) — FIRST.** Highest harm: without `?since/?until/?actor/?resource_id`
   the audit trail cannot answer the incident question it exists for. Medium effort, low-med risk,
   purely additive query params (no breaking wire change). Biggest forensic value per unit work.
2. **Telemetry overview core fields (row 5, minus `?os`) — SECOND.** `failure_rate` + `by_state`
   is the fleet-health number operators watch during a rollout; additive response fields are
   non-breaking. Pairs naturally with the rollout/telemetry story.
3. **Per-device telemetry pagination + newest-first + filters (row 4, fields phase-2) — THIRD.**
   Prevents the unbounded-history payload cliff; defer `duration_ms`/`bytes_transferred` until the
   ingest is confirmed to supply them. Breaking key change (`events`→`items`) means it needs the
   operator decision + a consumer sweep, so it sits behind the additive wins.
4. **Group member batch-add (row 8) — FOURTH.** Real ergonomics win for cohort building; breaking
   shape change so it rides with row 4 under the operator decision.
5. **Audit actor object (row 1) — FIFTH.** Restores the durable `user_id` join key; additive but
   needs the `users` resolution lookup; lower urgency than time-window filtering.
6. **`member_count` on `GroupView` (row 6 partial) — SIXTH.** Cheap UI affordance; do it alongside
   any group-handler touch.
7. **TRIM-spec items (rows 3, 7, and the `id`-key + `filter_criteria` + `?os` sub-parts of 5/6) —
   ANYTIME, doc-only.** No code; amend `operational_endpoints.md` + `openapi.yaml` so the prose
   stops disagreeing with the shipped code (§11.4.6 — divergences must not sit silently). Land these
   as a single doc-sync change because they cost nothing and immediately stop the spec from lying.

**Net:** do the three TRIM doc-syncs immediately (zero code, removes the standing divergence), then
work the WIDEN list in the 1→6 order above behind a single operator WIDEN/TRIM ruling per breaking
row (§11.4.66). Rows 1, 2, 5 are additive/non-breaking and can land without consumer coordination;
rows 4, 8 (and the actor-object visibility change in 1) are breaking wire changes that need the
as-built consumer sweep first.

## 7. blast_radius_summary

| layer | rows that touch it | what changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wire-struct unit tests | 1,3,4,5,6,8 | JSON tag / field-set assertions for `AuditLogEntry`, `TelemetryEventView`, `TelemetryOverview`, `GroupView`, `MemberAdd`→batch, `AuditLogList`/`AuditList` name |
| handler unit/integration tests | 1,2,4,5,8 | query-param parsing + validation (`400` on bad `since/until/limit`), newest-first ordering, batch idempotency + `not_found` partial success, aggregate edge (`failure_rate` at 0 devices) |
| store seam tests | 1,2,4,5,8 | `AuditFilter` (actor/resource/time), `TelemetryForDevice` (filter+cursor), new latest-per-device overview aggregate, `AddGroupMember`→`AddGroupMembers`, `member_count` query |
| e2e / HelixQA Challenge bank | 1,2,4,5,6,8 | audit-filter, fleet-health, device-history, group-CRUD, group-membership Challenges each re-assert the new shape with captured evidence (§11.4.69 / §11.4.83) |
| openapi.yaml | all 8 | path/schema definitions re-aligned to whichever side wins each row |
| audit middleware | 8 | none — `deriveAuditAction` already emits `group_member` verbs for the members sub-routes (`handlers_audit.go`), so batch-add stays correctly audited |

## 8. doc_sync_actions_if_trim_chosen

For every row the operator rules TRIM-spec, the prose spec and openapi MUST be amended in the same
change so they stop disagreeing with the shipped code (Constitution §11.4.6 — no silent
divergence; §11.4.65 — keep `.md`/`.html`/`.pdf` siblings in sync):

- Row 3 → `operational_endpoints.md` §4.3: rename response model `AuditList` → `AuditLogList`.
- Row 6 (id) → §6.1/§6.2: change `group_id` → `id` in the `Group`/`GroupView` examples.
- Row 6 (`filter_criteria`) → §6.1/§6.3: mark `filter_criteria` as "stored, MVP returns it but
  evaluation is deferred — static membership only" (the spec already half-says this at §6 intro).
- Row 7 → §6.2: note `GET /groups` is un-paginated in 1.0.0 (lean shape canonical); keep the
  paginated form as a documented future-widen.
- Row 5 (`?os`) → §5.2: drop `?os` from the 1.0.0 scope set (keep `?deployment_id` + time window).

This memo does **not** perform those edits — it recommends them pending the operator's per-row
ruling.

## 9. anti_bluff_unverified_register

Per Constitution §11.4.6, the following are explicitly **not asserted as fact** in this memo:

- **UNVERIFIED — effort/risk sizes.** The S/M/L sizes and LOW/MED risk labels are estimates from
  reading the handlers + store seam, not from a spiked implementation. Absolute hours are not
  claimed.
- **UNVERIFIED — telemetry rich fields availability (row 4).** Whether `store.TelemetryRecord` /
  the `ota-protocol` telemetry event already carries `duration_ms` / `bytes_transferred` (and
  `success` as a first-class field) was **not** confirmed; `handlers_telemetry.go` `TelemetryEventView`
  does not expose them, and the store record type was not read this pass. If the ingest does not
  supply them, widening to those fields would produce always-zero columns (a §11.4-bluff) — hence
  the "phase-2 / defer" qualifier on row 4.
- **UNVERIFIED — store-method availability for wider shapes.** The wider audit filter, paginated
  telemetry query, latest-per-device overview aggregate (`DISTINCT ON`), `member_count` count, and
  `AddGroupMembers` plural method are named by the spec (`operational_endpoints.md` §4.2/§5.3/§6.5)
  but their *existence in the pgx/in-memory `store.Repository`* was not verified here. Effort rises
  if these must be added to the store.
- **UNVERIFIED — HelixQA bank path.** `tools/helixqa/banks/atmosphere.yaml` is the constitutional
  convention (§11.4.58); its presence in *this* repo was not confirmed. "Bank" in §4/§7 means the
  project's Challenge bank wherever it lives.
- **UNVERIFIED — as-built external consumers.** The "breaking wire change" risk on rows 1/4/8
  assumes a consumer that already depends on the lean as-built shape. Whether such a consumer
