# Helix OTA Dashboard — Testing Guide

The dashboard ships a three-layer test pyramid. Every layer is **anti-bluff**
(Constitution §11.4): each test exercises real user-visible behaviour or real
client logic and asserts positive evidence — no metadata-only / grep-only passes.

| Layer | Tool | What it proves | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Typecheck | `tsc` (app + node + vitest configs) | App + test sources type-check clean | `tsconfig*.json` |
| Unit / Component | Vitest + @testing-library/react + jsdom | UI primitives, API client logic, the `useApi` state machine, and a screen's loading/empty/error states render correctly | `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` |
| Component a11y | vitest-axe | Overview empty-state has no axe violations (jsdom; color-contrast deferred to the browser layer) | `src/screens/OverviewScreen.test.tsx` |
| End-to-end | Playwright (Chromium) + the **real Go control plane** | The real SPA drives the real `/api/v1` API: login, every panel, rollout + recall, API-seeded group/member rendering | `e2e/*.spec.ts` |
| E2E a11y | @axe-core/playwright | Login + Overview pass WCAG 2.0/2.1 A+AA in a real browser (incl. color-contrast) | `e2e/a11y.spec.ts` |

## Commands

```bash
# 1. Install (adds the Vitest/RTL/jsdom/axe devDependencies)
npm install

# 2. Typecheck — app sources + the Node/Vite config + the Vitest test sources
npm run typecheck

# 3. Unit + component tests (fast, in-process, no server needed)
npm run test:run        # one-shot (CI)
npm test                # watch mode (local dev)
npm run test:ui         # Vitest UI (local dev; needs @vitest/ui)

# 4. End-to-end (builds + boots the real Go server on :8095, Vite on :4317)
#    Requires: Go toolchain on PATH + `npx playwright install chromium`
npx playwright test     # or: npm run e2e
```

## How the e2e layer works (no mocks)

`playwright.config.ts` + `e2e/global-setup.ts` build the Go control plane from
`../server/cmd/ota-server`, boot it in-memory on `:8095` with a seeded admin, and
run the Vite dev server on `:4317` proxying `/api` → `:8095`. Specs log in with the
seeded admin and drive real Chromium. `e2e/helpers.ts` seeds groups + members
through the **same** `/api/v1` endpoints the SPA uses, so UI assertions run against
genuine server state.

**Session note:** the SPA keeps access/refresh tokens **in memory only** (they are
cleared on a hard reload, per `src/auth/AuthContext.tsx`). E2e specs therefore
navigate **client-side** (nav links, in-app links, the in-app "Open by id" lookup
forms) — never a hard `page.goto` to a protected route, which would wipe the
session and redirect to `/login`.

## CI wiring (for the conductor)

The dashboard test job is purely local commands; suggested job body:

```yaml
# .github/workflows (out of this subagent's scope — wire as needed)
dashboard:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  defaults:
    run:
      working-directory: dashboard
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with: { submodules: recursive }
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with: { node-version: 22 }
    - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with: { go-version: '1.26' }      # needed by the Playwright global-setup build
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run typecheck
    - run: npm run test:run
    - run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
    - run: npx playwright test
```

Per §11.4.75 the project's remote CI is local-only; this job body is the documented
recipe the conductor can wire into the project's pre-build / release ritual.

### Signed-artifact seeding (how the populated detail paths are reached)

`e2e/global-setup.ts` now mints an **ephemeral ed25519 keypair** every run, passes
the raw 32-byte public key to the server via `HELIX_ARTIFACT_PUBKEY`, and stashes the
private key in a gitignored `.e2e-artifact-key.json` (removed by `global-teardown.ts`;
never committed — §11.4.10). `e2e/helpers.ts` `seedArtifact()` hand-builds a valid
**ZIP_STORED** archive (`payload.bin`), computes the lowercase-hex SHA-256 over the
whole zip, signs the **raw 32 digest bytes** with ed25519 (the exact server contract —
see `tests/e2e/pipeline_signed.sh` + `ota-artifact-validator` `stages.go`), and uploads
it via `POST /artifacts/upload`, asserting the real server returns `201` with
`verified: true`. `seedRelease` / `seedDeployment` / `seedRollout` then drive the rest
of the chain through the same `/api/v1` endpoints the SPA uses — no mocks (§11.4.27).
`e2e/populated-detail.spec.ts` consumes these to render a **populated Release detail**,
a **populated Deployment detail with a real staged-rollout phase table**, and a
sink-side proof that the seeded artifact is stored + verified (§11.4.69).

> **Shared-server note.** The single in-memory control plane is shared across all
> specs, so once `populated-detail.spec.ts` seeds a release the global `/releases`
> list is no longer empty. The `releases`/`smoke` "fresh server" assertions were
> therefore relaxed to accept the empty-state **or** a populated table (the strict
> empty-state assertion lives at the component layer in `OverviewScreen.test.tsx`).

### Honest gaps (not yet covered, and why)

- **Per-device Fleet detail success path:** the device-status success path needs a
  seeded device; covered at the empty/404 level only via the live overview.
- **color-contrast at the component layer** is disabled under jsdom (no canvas) and
  is instead asserted in the real browser by `e2e/a11y.spec.ts`.

*(Closed in this wave: the ArtifactUpload screen — now 7 component tests — and the
populated Release/Deployment/rollout detail success paths — now real-signed-artifact
e2e seeding + populated-detail e2e specs.)*
